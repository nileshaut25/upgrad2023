# Lending Club Case Study

This company serves as the largest platform for online loans, enabling individuals to secure personal loans, businesses to access financing, and individuals to finance medical procedures. Through a user-friendly online interface, borrowers can easily obtain loans at lower interest rates.

Similar to many other lending firms, the primary cause of financial losses for this company is lending to applicants deemed "risky," resulting in what's known as credit loss. Credit loss refers to the money lost by the lender when borrowers fail to repay their loans or disappear with the borrowed funds. Essentially, borrowers who default on their loans contribute the most significant losses to the lenders. In this context, customers labeled as 'charged-off' are considered defaulters.

The main goal of this case study is to identify these high-risk loan applicants using exploratory data analysis (EDA). By doing so, the company aims to reduce the number of risky loans, ultimately decreasing the overall credit loss. This knowledge can be invaluable for the company's portfolio management and risk assessment.

In simpler terms, the company wants to pinpoint the key factors (or driver variables) that lead to loan defaults, such as the variables that strongly indicate the likelihood of default. This information can be applied to enhance the company's understanding of its domain and improve its risk analytics, ultimately assisting in making more informed lending decisions. To gain a better grasp of the field, it's advisable to conduct some independent research on risk analytics, focusing on the types of variables involved and their significance.
